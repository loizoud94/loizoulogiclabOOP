## Overview
The OOP Email Simulator is a Python program that simulates basic email functionality using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. It allows users to create, manage, and interact with email objects, organized into folders such as Inbox, Junk Folder, and Deleted Folder. The program provides a simple command-line interface to perform actions like reading emails, marking as read or unread, moving to different folders, and deleting emails.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/loizoud94/loizoulogiclabOOP.git
   cd loizoulogiclapOOP
   ```

2. **Run the Program:**
   ```bash
   python email.py


## Features
- **Email Class:**
  - Represents individual emails with attributes like email address, subject line, and content.
  - Provides methods to mark emails as read, unread, spam, or normal.

- **Folders:**
